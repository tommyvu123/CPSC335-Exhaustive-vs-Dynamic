**The Hypothesis**
-	This experiment will test the following hypothesis:
-	Polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithms are more efficient than exponential-time exhaustive search algorithms that solve the same problem.

**A)	Is there a noticeable difference in the performance of the two algorithms? Which is faster, and by how much? Does this surprise you?**
There is a clear difference in the performance between the dynamic algorithm and the exhaustive search algorithm. This is no surprise because the exhaustive search has a time complexity of O(2n*n) which is exponential. This causes it to take way longer for it to execute as compared to the dynamic algorithm. 

**B)	Are your empirical analyses consistent with your mathematical analyses? Justify your answer.**
Yes, the empirical analysis is consistent with the mathematical analysis because for both algorithms, they match the time complexities.

**C)	Is this evidence consistent or inconsistent with the hypothesis? Justify your answer.**
Yes, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithms are more efficient than exponential-time exhaustive search algorithms that solve the same problem. This is because the exhaustive algorithm has an exponential time, whereas the dynamic algorithm has a polynomial time complexity. This results in the dynamic program being more efficient than the exhaustive algorithm.
